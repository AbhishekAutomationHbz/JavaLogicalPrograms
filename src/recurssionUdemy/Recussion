Recurssion is the process of a function calling itself.

Generally whenever there is same logic is repeating we have to use recusion.
eg:- traversing binary trees.
 eg1:
def factorial(n)
	if n==0
		return
	
	else
		return n*factorial(n-1)
		

eg2:
		factorial(3) = 3*2*1
		factorial(3) = 3*factorial(2)
		factorial(2) = 2*factorial(1)
		factorial(1) = 1*factorial(1)
		factorial(n) = n*factorial(n-1)
